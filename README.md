### Description

Military is my simple special Wordpress Multilingual Landing theme for military history exhibition.
My client needed to create new site and I created it from scratch based on a PSD template.
In progress of work I used to jquery plugins for the lazy-load images, Fancybox for modal shows and Ajax for loading gallery content(video and photos).
scss is used for the layout, the content is transmitted by the ACF pro plugin (text type fields, WP editor, checkboxes, file, etc.); 
feedback form (including sending as a csv file) is a custom, its code is in the functions.php file, ajax function in js/ajax.js
As part of an integrated approach, the WP Yoast SEO plugin was also used with caching and minification plugins. For multilingual I used to Polylang WP plugin.
Also since the client had no need to support older browsers, I used images with .webp resolution as recommended by Google
